# Pre-course Learning

Learning to be an awesome web developer requires a lot of new concepts. To help bring it all together we have put together a 4 week pre-course plan to lay the foundations that we will build on in the course. It is split into 4 challenges, each with a submission deadline so we can monitor your progress and understand your current skill level in advance of the course starting.

## Some suggestions:

-   Build stuff. The most important thing while learning to code is to write code. Just like learning to play guitar, you can’t learn to code just by reading about it. It takes practice, lots of it (about 12 weeks by our calculations!).
-   Follow along with the video, even if what is being shown seems trivial. It will cement the ideas in your memory if you physically type them out.
-   Pause videos and go back when the concepts are going too fast. Make sure you understand what has been shown before continuing to the next concept.
-   At this point, there is more value in learning 5 things properly than 50 things badly. Take your time.
-   Don’t be constrained to the videos that we suggest. If, for example you’re struggling to understand JavaScript functions. Googling ‘JavaScript Functions’ would be a great start.
-   Explore beyond where the videos take you. Be curious and create your own micro-challenges to check you understand. A really good test for this is to take someone you know that doesn’t know code and explain it to them (if they’re good don’t forget to refer them to the course!).
-   Dedicate blocks of 4 hours to work on course material. Every time you switch away to do something else you lose time while you switch context. If possible, spread your learning over multiple days so your brain has time to digest concepts overnight rather than cram it all into one day. It will be much less stressful and you’ll get better results.

We have trawled the web on your behalf to find the best possible learning without actually being here with our trainers on the \_nology course. There are an excellent set of videos by ‘The Net Ninja’ that we thoroughly recommend, as his videos are free they are a great resource to take advantage of.

Typically we would expect a 1:2 ratio between watching and understanding. For example, for each hour of video, we would expect you to spend at least 2 hours to consolidate the concept fully. This is self-paced time, pausing videos, playing, exploring and expanding ideas.

Regardless of your experience, complete all the learning. We guarantee there will be things that you don’t know and bad habits that need work on. Every day on the \_nology course builds on the last, so if any concepts are missed it has a direct impact on later learning.

Remember - you’ll be presenting your challenge output to the other students on the first day of the course so make it worth talking about!

## Reflection questions

After each challenge, include in your submission the answers to the following questions

-   What was the most interesting thing you learned?
